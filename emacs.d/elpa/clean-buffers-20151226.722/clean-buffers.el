;;; Commentary:

;; clean-buffers is a little tool that used to clean useless buffers
;; which means buffers who's name match specify regex
;; (see `clean-buffer-useless-buffer-names')
;; or undisplayed time exceeded certain time
;; (see `clean-buffer-useless-buffer-timeout')

;; Quick start:

;; config `useless-buffer-names' or `useless-buffer-time-out' and then
;; execute the following commands:
;; `clean-buffers-kill-useless-buffers' to clean useless buffers
;; or `clean-buffers-turn-on-auto-clean-buffers' to clean useless buffers automatically
