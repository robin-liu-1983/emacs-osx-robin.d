* Ada mode 5.1.9
20 Jan 2016

** New option ada-indent-comment-gnat matches the GNAT style check for
   comments in all cases (previously, there were some cases where the
   comment indent algorithm did not match the GNAT check).

** New menu command "Show source file search path"; displays
   compilation-search-path in a buffer.

** Adding missing grammar statements to allow removing parens around
   conditional and quantified expressions.

** Key binding for ada-case-create-partial-exception in ada-mode
   changed to C-c C-M-y; this is easier to type, and matches the key
   binding in gpr-mode.

** ada-case-keyword changed to accept the symbols 'lower-case,
   'upper-case instead of the functions downcase-word, upcase-word.

** ada-case-identifier changed to accept the symbols 'mixed-case,
   'lower-case, 'upper-case instead of the functions 'ada-mixed-case,
   'ada-lower-case, 'ada-upper-case.

** ada-fix-add-context-clause now sorts "limited with" and "private
   with" clauses after other clauses.

** ada-align now aligns '=>' in case expressions.

** ada-align-paramlist now handles access function parameters:

   procedure Choose
     (X, Y, Z    :        Integer;
      Preference : access function (A, B : Integer) return Boolean);

** ada-next-statement-keyword now moves to matching close paren if on
   open paren, ada-prev-statement-keyword moves from close paren to
   open paren.

** New hook ada-prj-parse-hook, run from ada-parse-prj-file.

** GPR mode now does case adjust similar to Ada mode.

** gpr parser handles nested case statements without blowing up.

** gpr parser handles package renames

** fix other bugs

* Ada mode 5.1.8
10 Apr 2015

** requires OpenToken 6.0

** ada-align handle identifiers that start with Ada keywords

** functions for ada-case-identifier now take three args: start, end,
   force-case

** parsing is not required by find-other-file if the current buffer is
   larger than wisi-size-threshold

** fix misc bugs

* Ada mode 5.1.7
18 Nov 2014

** add ada-find-file that prompts for a file from the current project,
   with completion.

** fix bug that prevented
    Y : Boolean := Boolean'(if True then False);

** add ada-create-select-default-prj, to simplify working with small
   projects

** Handle deleting whitespace between words, inserting whitespace in
   the middle of a word properly.

** Change ada-case-adjust to capitalize words in comments and strings
   by default; C-u adjusts case as if code.

** allow 'raise' in expressions for GNAT GPL 2014 aspects

** move all except keyword face highighting to grammar; much more
   accurate, easier to maintain, simpler, faster.

** delete gnatinspect support; gpr_query is better

** misc bug fixes

* Ada mode 5.1.6
28 Sep 2014

** improve syntax highlighting of names after 'of', 'new', 'renames'

** fix ada-format-paramlist to handle 'aliased' keyword (new in Ada
   2012), and 'not null' without 'access'.

** fix ada-find-other-file in separate bodies; now navigates to the
   spec.

** restore ada-indent-newline-indent for [return]

* Ada mode 5.1.5
12 Jul 2014

** add C-c <, C-c >; goto-declaration-start, -end

** improve parsing speed significantly

* Ada mode 5.1.4
26 May 2014

** support expression functions

** beginning-of-defun-function, end-of-defun-function are now set. A
   "defun" is a generic, package, protected, subprogram, or task spec
   or body.

** C-c C-s is now bound to ada-goto-previous-pos, which goes to the
   first position in ada-goto-pos-ring. Most navigation functions set
   ada-goto-pos-ring. This allows easy navigation back to the start of
   a cross-reference chain.

** xref tool error handlers no longer show the xref tool buffer; the
   new Ada menu item 'show xref tool buffer' can be used instead.

** The parser supports more deeply nested case statements.

* Ada mode 5.1.3
19 Apr 2014

** more GNAT error message auto-fixes

** support aspects on subprogram declarations; format same as SPARK examples.

** fix bug in ada-syntax-propertize that caused query-replace to screw up

** inhibit reparse due to case adjust; case adjust entire buffer is
   now _much_ faster.

** Non-ASCII characters supported in Ada mode buffers, including GNAT
   bracket notation.

* Ada mode 5.1.2
16 Mar 2014

** fix another packaging bug; forgot to add files to ELPA git!

* Ada mode 5.1.1
14 Mar 2014

** require wisi-1.0.2, to fix packaging bug

** gnat-find now called with -a to include read-only .ali files in the results.

* Ada mode 5.1.0
13 Mar 2014

** Emacs 24.2 supported, via cl-lib in Gnu ELPA

** Better handling of aspects.

** 'record' is aligned with 'type' in derived types

** Several minor indentation bugs have been fixed.

** Added "2.2 Upgrading from previous versions" to the user guide.

** ada-align now properly handles subprograms with the opening paren
   on the same line as the preceding code and code on the same line as
   the closing paren:

    function Foo (Param_1 : Integer;
                  Param_2 : Integer) return Integer;

** When no project file is selected, the default variables are
   consistently used instead. Previously, the default variables were
   only used when parsing a project file.

** info files are properly visible in main info menu

** 'C-c ;' used to run `comment-dim', which is bound to 'M-;' in the
   global keymap. 'C-c ;' now gives an error with a message saying
   'use M-; instead'.

* Ada mode 5.0.1
Feb 2 2014

First public release, via ELPA

* Ada mode 5.0.0
Dec 24 2013

** first release in ELPA

** Previous version was 4.00, in Emacs core. 5.0.1 is a complete
   rewrite, using a generalized LALR parser that caches syntactic
   information in text properties.
